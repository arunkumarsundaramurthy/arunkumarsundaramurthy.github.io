Malvan is a budding tourist destination. It is 400 Kms from Pune and 550 Kms from Mumbai by road. Our main reason to visit Malvan was for the scuba diving. 

#Arrangements done:
1. Tickets in Paulo travels for Pune-Kudal.
2. Accommodation. Many resorts are available there (including MTDC).
3. Tickets in Neeta travels for Kudal-Pune.

#Day 0 - Friday:

We boarded our bus at [Yerwada](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yerwada "Yerwada"), Pune at around 10 PM.

#Day 1 - Saturday:

We reached [Kudal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kudal "Kudal") at 7.30 AM. There was a bus stand opposite to the place where we got down. But we could not find any bus at that time to [Malvan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malvan "Malvan"). So, we decided to go by auto to our resort. We got auto for ₹500 after bargain. It was a 1.5 hours travel from Kudal to Malvan. The terrain and scenery was really good. We were able to see a lot of coconut trees on both side of the road, open land, a small river.

After refreshment at the resort, and looking at India score in the World Cup match we went for a swim at the [Tarkarli](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarkarli "Tarkarli") beach. Then we went to [Tsunami island](https://www.google.co.in/maps/place/Tsunami+Island/@15.974749,73.504232,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x78caad010fe9c714?sa=X&ei=cG8hVYXAEcSjugSMroCwBw&ved=0CIABEPwSMA4 "Tsunami Island (Malvan)") for water sports. It was about 20 minutes travel from MTDC. We got to do water bike, bumper ride, banana ride, and boat ride for ₹700. You can take mobile phones to tsunami island as these people have a box to put them safely. We spent some time swimming there at the island. There is a small hotel at the place from where you get boat to the island. We spent some time there after having our tea at the hotel. Its a good place. They have seats and swings over there for people to relax in the shade of coconut trees.

After having lunch at the resort we went to Sindhudurg fort. There is nothing much at the fort, but good to go in the evening. We had our dinner at [Atithi Bamboo](http://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g1227937-d3803116-Reviews-Athithi_Bamboo-Malvan_Maharashtra.html Atithi Bamboo) restaurant.

We were little bit worried as it was raining. Because we can’t see clearly underwater in low light.

We made arrangement for Scuba diving for the next day through our resort.

#Day 2 - Sunday:

Scuba diving is done in the waters close to Sindhudurg fort. We went there by around 8 AM. Scuba diving was an awesome experience. You get to see the coral, fishes. The best part is, you don’t need to know swimming. Those people take good care of you under water. They also take photos and video of you.

>After dipping into the sea, all I could see was greenish blue. I didn’t even feel like I was swimming until I reached the bottom to see the coral. The thing that struck my mind was `Theory of Relativity`. As I could not see any other object, I could not feel my movement. Some told that they had a little pain in their ears due to pressure.

[Rock garden](http://www.tripadvisor.in/Attraction_Review-g1227937-d3823244-Reviews-Rock_Garden-Malvan_Maharashtra.html "Rock Garden") is a close by place, and good to visit in the evening. You get to see a lot of crab over there.

We came back to our resort, spent the entire evening in Tarkarli beach. We had our evening snacks and dinner at MTDC resort. And again spent some time in the beach, looking at the light house and using [Google Sky Map].

We played Uno and Mafia till 12AM. 

#Day 3 - Monday:

I alone made a walk for 1 hour in the Tarkarli beach, clicking some photos. We checked out at 10AM and reached Kudal by jeep. We got our bus to Pune at 12.30PM. We played Connect in the bus. The bus brokedown at [Satara](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satara_district "Satara"). As it was getting late, we arranged a van from there to Pune.


>It was an Experience worth experiencing again.
